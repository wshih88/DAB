## Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends
### Challenge
Based on the Kickstarter data, there is a noticeable successful trend for plays that start their crowdfunding campaign in the months of June, July, and August, with July being the most successful month to intiate a crowdfunding campaign. Winter campaigns from November to January tend to be not as successful. There seems to be a direct relationship between the crowdfunding goal and its success rate. The general trends seem to indicate that the higher dollar value the campaign goal, the more likely to fail. Based on our charts, we noted that the ideal goal range to be less than $1000. Solely based on our findings, the ideal time and goal for a play to initiate a Kickstarter is in July with a target fund less than $1000. This study however, is only indicative of Kickstarters, not other crowdfunding websites, and does not account for certain factors such as geographic location. This study's scope includes multiple countries and is stacked year over year which could influenced by economic shifts. In attempt to establish a predictive model, it may be better to separate data by country and by year.
